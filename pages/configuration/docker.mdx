description: How to configure your docker-compose file for Postiz
---

You will often see, when for example configuring providers, that the environment variables will look like this:
```env
INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_ID=12345678901234567890
```
You have 2 options on how to set these variables in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

1. You can set them directly in the `environment` section of the service.

docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
services:
  postiz:
    environment:
      YOUR_ENV_VAR: "value"
      YOUR_OTHER_ENV_VAR: "value"
```

2. You can use a `.env` file to set the variables.

docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
services:
  postiz:
    env_file:
      - .env
```
.env:
```env
YOUR_ENV_VAR=value
YOUR_OTHER_ENV_VAR=value
```

3. You can also use both!

docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
services:
  postiz:
    environment:
      YOUR_ENV_VAR: "value"
    env_file:
      - .env
```
.env:
```env
YOUR_OTHER_ENV_VAR=value
```

Now you need to note that when using an .env file, you will need to transder all enviroment variables from the docker-compose.yml file to the .env file.
An .env file will ovveride any variables set in the .yml file.
Using an .env file for the DB / Redis wont be neccessary.
