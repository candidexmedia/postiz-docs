### Step 7 Activate YouTubes API
Go to Activated APIs and Services. Then click on Activate APIs and Services. Search YouTube Data API v3 and activate the API by clicking it and clicking Activate.

```

ADDITIONAL STEPS FOR BRAND ACCOUNTS
Note: When using a Brand account you will need to set your APP to External and setup a test user.
You do not need to publish the APP, but it does take time for the changes to propagate. 
You will also need to add the app to the trusted apps within your google workspace Admin. 

### Step 1 Go to admin.google.com
sign in

### Step 2 go to Security --> Access and data Controls --> API Controls
Click Manage Third Party App Access

### Step 3 Click Configure new App
Put your Client ID for the app you created in previous steps into the search box and select your app

### Step 4 Set scopes and Google Data Access for the app to Trusted
Once set, click save

### Step 5 Wait at least 5 hours for the changes to propegate.
After this time you should now be able to add your Youtube channel to your Postiz account
