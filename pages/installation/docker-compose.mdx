## Docker Compose

This guide assumes that you have docker installed, with a reasonable amount of resources to run Postiz. This Docker Compose setup has been tested with;

- Virtual Machine, Ubuntu 24.04, 4Gb RAM, 2 vCPUs.

<Prereqs />

### Configuration uses environment variables

The docker containers for Postiz are entirely configured with environment variables.

- **Option A** - environment variables in your `docker-compose.yml` file
- **Option B** - environment variables in a `postiz.env` file mounted in `/config` for the Postiz container only
- **Option C** - environment variables in a `.env` file next to your `docker-compose.yml` file (not recommended).

... or a mixture of the above options!

There is a [configuration reference](/configuration/reference/) page with a list
of configuration settings.

## Example `docker-compose.yml` file

```yaml
services:
  postiz:
    image: ghcr.io/gitroomhq/postiz-app:latest
    container_name: postiz
    restart: always
    environment:
      # You must change these. Replace `postiz.your-server.com` with your DNS name - this needs to be exactly the URL you're accessing Postiz on.
      MAIN_URL: "https://postiz.your-server.com"
      FRONTEND_URL: "https://postiz.your-server.com"
      NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL: "https://postiz.your-server.com/api"
      JWT_SECRET: "random string that is unique to every install - just type random characters here!"

      # These defaults are probably fine, but if you change your user/password, update it in the
      # postiz-postgres or postiz-redis services below.
      DATABASE_URL: "postgresql://postiz-user:postiz-password@postiz-postgres:5432/postiz-db-local"
      REDIS_URL: "redis://postiz-redis:6379"
      BACKEND_INTERNAL_URL: "http://localhost:3000"
      IS_GENERAL: "true" # Required for self-hosting.
      DISABLE_REGISTRATION: "true" # Only allow single registration, then disable signup
      # The container images are pre-configured to use /uploads for file storage.
      # You probably should not change this unless you have a really good reason!
      STORAGE_PROVIDER: "local"
      UPLOAD_DIRECTORY: "/uploads"
      NEXT_PUBLIC_UPLOAD_DIRECTORY: "/uploads"
    volumes:

      interval: 10s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 3
    volumes:
      - postiz-redis-data:/data
    networks:
      - postiz-network


volumes:
  postgres-volume:
    external: false

  postiz-redis-data:
    external: false

  postiz-config:

## How to use docker compose

Save the file contents to `docker-compose.yml` in your directory you create for postiz.

Run `docker compose up` to start the services.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Note** When you change variables, you must run `docker compose down` and
  then `docker compose up` to recreate these containers with these updated
  variables.
</Callout>

Look through the logs for startup errors, and if you have problems, check out the [support](/support/) page.

If everything looks good, then you can access the Postiz web interface at https://postiz.your-server.com
